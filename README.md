<h1>US PCE Forecast Using Principal Component Analysis</h1>

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces the dimensionality of a dataset without losing much of the variation in the dataset.
<br>
<br>
To forecast Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), I used nearly 80 leading economic data series. I applied PCA to decompose the dataset into eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

Each eigenvector, more commonly known as a principal component (PC), corresponds to an eigenvalue that tells you its explanatory power - the bigger the eigenvalue, the more variation it explains in the dataset.
 <br>
  <br>
Following a rule of thumb, I selected the top four principal components with the highest explanatory power (highest eigenvalues), which together account for the majority of the variation in the dataset.

Next, I used these principal components, lagged by two months, as inputs to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. The chart below compares the modelâ€™s projections to the PCE values.

  <br>
All in all, the model performs reasonably well in capturing the general trend of PCE. However, for precise point forecasts, the model needs modification.
